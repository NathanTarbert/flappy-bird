# flappy-bird
This game is deployed to: https://nathans-flappy-bird-game.netlify.app/

The idea is to build a simple flappy bird game using only Javascript, HTML and CSS. This is an ongoing project... 

The game is fully functional, that passes through pipes and counts as the user plays. If a collision is made with a pipe the game ends and the number of pipes you passed through are displayed.
